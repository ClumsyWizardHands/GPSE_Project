- **Content**: The international security environment adds urgency to this discussion. China’s military modernization, including its development of fifth-generation fighters and anti-access/area-denial capabilities, poses a growing challenge to U.S. airpower. Russia, despite its economic constraints, continues to invest in advanced aircraft and air defenses, while smaller powers like Iran and North Korea are expanding their own capabilities. [...] China’s development of advanced fighters like the J-20 and Russia’s deployment of the Su-57 have intensified the need for cutting-edge aircraft, and critics of the cuts may warn that scaling back the F-35 program risks ceding technological superiority to adversaries.

- **Content**: The number of nations now operating in orbit or beyond is one major difference between the first Cold War “space race” and what is now unfolding. So too is the speed of technological advances and the role of the private sector, particularly SpaceX and its billionaire founder, Elon Musk.

The U.S. and its Western allies are currently in a race with a combined Chinese-Russian collaborative project to return humans to the moon. [...] While much of that face-off inevitably takes place in secret, developments in the last two years have included U.S. claims Russia was developing a nuclear device to explode in orbit, a classified U.S. unmanned “spaceplane” that landed in Florida in March after a reported record 434-day mission in orbit, and President Donald Trump’s mooted new U.S. “Golden Dome” missile defense shield. [...] Last week, a U.S. military spokesperson told Breaking Defense that another Russian “space object” launched at the end of May appeared to be closely tracking a U.S. governm...

- **Content**: The remains of a destroyed Russian tank sits in a field near the Russian town of Sudzha.

The Russians have the mass to absorb those losses. Ukraine has struggled with weapon and ammo shortages, as well as deficiencies in manpower. Ukraine turned to small, cheap drones as an asymmetric warfare alternative; Russia has employed uncrewed systems in battle as well.

China, another concern in the West, has built a similar kind of force, one with the mass to take losses. [...] Russia has one of the world's largest militaries backed by a large population. The country has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to pursue an attritional style of warfare, committing a lot of troops and weaponry to a fight to slowly wear down its foe.

Russia's invasion has chewed through equipment. The UK Ministry of Defense said in December that Russia had lost over 3,600 main battle tanks and almost 8,000 armored vehicles since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. [...] The "enormous rate of damage," ...

Further, with the large security presence of the U.S. and its allies in the Caribbean, China would have nothing to gain from an offensive military posture in the region. Though self-evident, this explains why the U.S has chosen to frame China’s presence in the Caribbean not in economic terms, but as a technological and geopolitical “threat”—going so [...] Washington’s aim of permanent hegemony in the region is being challenged by an increasingly multipolar world, and this accounts for the US attempt to limit China’s influence in the Caribbean. For example, U.S. tariff assaults on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) stems from U.S. insecurities about China’s economic growth alongside its manufacturing and technological developments.( extension of infrastructural, technological, and other tangible material developments to states lower down on t...

- **Content**: A cyberattack on any aspect of a space system can degrade situational awareness and readiness across all domains. As space becomes the connective tissue of joint operations, cyber becomes a mandatory overlay to all aspects — launch, orbital, terrestrial and link. A single breach can ripple across the entire mission, which is why cyber strategy must move beyond traditional offense and defense to become a core part of system design. [...] For space to function as an operational domain, we must build it like one — resilient, interoperable and ready for conflict. To achieve “tactically relevant space” we need to advance in four key areas: real-time, AI-powered data processing; open systems; decentralized execution; and cybersecurity — together enabling an agile, interoperable mission capability.

That is—and will continue to be—the working thesis until more trade deals are announced or there is some sort of definitive long-term tariff and trade permanence that drives supply chain certainty, which can, in turn, bring some stability and confidence to what is currently a bumpy road.

But regardless of how things shake out, continued fluctuations and uncertainty (there is that word again) figure to be prominently involved.

- **Content**: In addition to the CER Directive, the EU has also promulgated the Network and Information Security (NIS2) Directive to deal specifically with threats to the network and information security of its critical infrastructure organisations. This Directive requires entities to take an all-hazards approach to the security risk management of their network and information systems.

Some measures critical infrastructure organisations must take include: 

UK: Cyber Security and Resilience Bill [...] High-profile cyberattacks on leading energy providers only serve to back up this data.

Of course, Australia boasts a robust framework for managing critical infrastructure security, thanks to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (SOCI).

But Australia isn’t the only country dealing with constant attack attempts on its critical infrastructure assets – peers in the US, UK and the EU face similar – and often even greater – levels of threat. [...] At Noggin, we recommend introducing flexibilit...
