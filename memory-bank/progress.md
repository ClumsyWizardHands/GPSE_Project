## Known Issues

### Current Bugs
- None identified yet

### Technical Debt
1. No comprehensive error handling in `db_manager.py`
2. Missing input validation in utility functions
3. No unit tests implemented
4. Logging could be more structured

### Performance Concerns
- ChromaDB queries not optimized for large datasets
- No caching mechanism for repeated queries
- Embedding generation is synchronous (could be batched)

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing
- [x] ChromaDB basic operations
- [x] Document processing and chunking
- [x] Query functionality with sample queries
- [ ] Full end-to-end workflow
- [ ] API integration testing
- [ ] Agent interaction testing

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for utilities (0%)
- [ ] Integration tests for database (0%)
- [ ] Agent behavior tests (0%)
- [ ] End-to-end tests (0%)

## Next Milestones

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Dependency Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install crewai python-dotenv openai anthropic requests tavily-python
   ```

2. **Create Agent Definitions**
   - Define CrewAI agents with roles and goals
   - Implement custom tools for ChromaDB access
   - Set up LLM configurations

3. **API Integration Setup**
   - Create news API client wrapper
   - Implement Tavily search functionality
   - Configure LLM API connections

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Complete CrewAI workflow implementation
2. Run first end-to-end test
3. Implement basic error handling
4. Create main execution script

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Add comprehensive logging
2. Implement caching layer
3. Create unit and integration tests
4. Set up automated scheduling
5. Optimize performance

## Resource Tracking

### API Keys Needed
- [ ] OpenAI API Key
- [ ] Anthropic API Key
- [ ] News API Key (at least one)
- [ ] Tavily API Key

### Estimated Costs
- GPT-3.5: ~$0.50-$2.00/day
- GPT-4/Claude: ~$5-$20/day (depending on usage)
- News APIs: Free tier likely sufficient
- Tavily: Check pricing tiers

### Time Investment
- Initial setup: ~8-16 hours
- Daily operation: ~5-15 minutes runtime
- Weekly maintenance: ~1-2 hours

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Daily analysis generation success rate
- [ ] Average processing time < 15 minutes
- [ ] Query response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero data loss over 30 days

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Relevant historical context retrieved
