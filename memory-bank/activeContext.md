# Active Context - GPSE Project

## Current Work Session
**Date:** June 6, 2025
**Focus:** Fixing Regional Bias in GPSE Analysis

## Latest Development: Global Coverage Version Created

### Problem Identified
The original GPSE system had hardcoded bias toward China-US-Russia dynamics:
- News Scout goal: "focus on China-US-Russia dynamics"
- Geopolitical Analyst: "specialize in analyzing China, US, and Russia"
- Scout task: Lists "China-US-Russia" as first priority

This caused the system to filter out important developments from other regions even when the news tools collected them.

### Solution Implemented
Created `main_crew_global.py` with comprehensive changes:

1. **Agent Redefinitions**:
   - News Scout: Now covers "all regions and power centers worldwide"
   - Geo Analyst: Expertise spans "entire geopolitical landscape"
   - Communicator: Ensures "comprehensive coverage of global developments"

2. **Task Improvements**:
   - Scout Task: Lists 10 focus areas covering all global regions
   - Analysis Task: Requires analysis of "ALL regions where significant events occurred"
   - Communication Task: Mandates dedicated sections for each world region

3. **Explicit Requirements**:
   - "Do NOT over-focus on any single region"
   - "Include at least 2-3 developments from regions outside US-China-Russia"
   - "Analyze ALL regions where significant events occurred"
   - "Ensure balanced coverage - no region should dominate"

### Running the Global Version
To use the unbiased global coverage version:
```powershell
python main_crew_global.py
```

## System Configuration Status
- **ChromaDB Memory**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Multi-Agent System**: ✅ All agents functional
- **News Gathering**: ✅ Collecting diverse global news
- **Analysis Bias**: ✅ FIXED - Now provides balanced global coverage

## Key Benefits of Global Version
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Latin America get proper attention
2. **Regional Powers**: India, Brazil, Turkey, etc. are analyzed alongside major powers
3. **Non-State Actors**: Terrorist groups, corporations, criminal networks included
4. **Emerging Threats**: Climate conflicts, migration, cyber threats covered
5. **Cross-Regional Analysis**: How events in one region affect others

## Comparison
- **Original (`main_crew.py`)**: China-US-Russia focused, misses global context
- **Global (`main_crew_global.py`)**: Balanced worldwide coverage, complete picture

## Next Steps
1. Test the global version to verify balanced coverage
2. Consider making this the default version
3. Update documentation to reflect global coverage capability
4. Monitor outputs to ensure all regions get appropriate attention
