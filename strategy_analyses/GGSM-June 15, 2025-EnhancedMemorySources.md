- **Content**: Its director, Gen Jami Shawley, an Africa specialist appointed to the role only in March, has now been assigned to more general strategic functions.

Addressing Congress this week, Gen Langley warned about China's and Russia's African ambitions: Beijing's agility at capitalising on the US's absence and Moscow's ability to seize military opportunities created by chaos and instability. [...] What matters to the no-longer-so-new Trump II administration, the general made clear in a Pentagon publication last week, is fighting terrorists - particularly those who might attack the US.

Other priorities are countering the spread of Chinese military influence across Africa and protecting freedom of maritime navigation through key trade choke points such as the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal and the Bab el-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.

- **Content**: The number of nations now operating in orbit or beyond is one major difference between the first Cold War “space race” and what is now unfolding. So too is the speed of technological advances and the role of the private sector, particularly SpaceX and its billionaire founder, Elon Musk.

The U.S. and its Western allies are currently in a race with a combined Chinese-Russian collaborative project to return humans to the moon. [...] While much of that face-off inevitably takes place in secret, developments in the last two years have included U.S. claims Russia was developing a nuclear device to explode in orbit, a classified U.S. unmanned “spaceplane” that landed in Florida in March after a reported record 434-day mission in orbit, and President Donald Trump’s mooted new U.S. “Golden Dome” missile defense shield. [...] Last week, a U.S. military spokesperson told Breaking Defense that another Russian “space object” launched at the end of May appeared to be closely tracking a U.S. governm...

- **Content**: Taiwan has become a focal point for the U.S.-China conflict, with the Pentagon turning its attention towards a hypothetical conflict with China — referring to it as the “sole pacing threat” — and Chinacontinuingcombat and blockade drills around the island. [...] For years now, the United States has justifiably wanted its allies to pick up a bigger share of the burden of their own defense.

But as America now asks its partners to boost military spending to 5% of GDP, the sheer scale of these demands — especially on allies in East Asia — could push yields higher on U.S. Treasury bonds at a time when they are already under pressure by skeptical global bond investors and ratings agencies. [...] Geopolitically, China would have to reckon with the Global South and BRICS nations, whose trade relies on the straits even more than the G7. Given that China is courting these nations diplomatically, impeding their trade could set off a diplomatic fiasco that Beijing would likely want to avoid.

- **Content**: From a strategic perspective, the other branches tend to be more vulnerable to asymmetric tactics from a cost/benefit or return on investment (ROI) perspective. On the seas, a handful of anti-ship missiles can cripple an entire fleet. In the air, a few truckloads of autonomous explosive drones can neuter billions of dollars of your air superiority, and a few well-placed anti-satellite missiles can remove theater-wide informational advantage. Obviously, the same cat-and-mouse game of trying to [...] Chief of Staff Allvin’s reasoning sounds logical, but in a world of competing interests and finite resources, we must be wary of falling victim to the “shiny object” fallacy, whereby the newest whiz-bang battlefield technology tries to replace tried and true tenets of warfighting.

- **Relevance Score**: 0.064
- **Content**: Despite the rhetoric on economic self-reliance, both the U.S. and China have much to lose from a prolonged trade war. According to the military think tank RAND, “roughly 40 percent of China’s exports to the United States fall into categories where China supplies more than half of America’s total imports.” Meanwhile, China is eager to gain access to GPUs and CPUs from American companies like NVIDIA and AMD to power its growing AI infrastructure. [...] Geopolitical undercurrents will also further limit any long-term détente. In Washington, a bipartisan consensus has emerged around the need to “de‐risk” critical supply chains, not merely as a commercial maneuver but as a national security imperative. Policymakers and industry leaders alike fear that overdependence on China for semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, rare‐earth minerals, and even basic manufacturing capacity leaves the United States dangerously exposed to coercive economic pressure or [...] abrupt supply shocks.

### Article 11 (Source: worldnews)
- **Title**: US air power intensifies on ISIS-Somalia
- **URL**: https://horseedmedia.net/us-air-power-intensifies-on-isis-somalia/406523/
- **Published**: 2025-06-13 15:03:40
- **Author**: Horseed Staff
- **Content**: The mission, executed with no civilian casualties reported, marks the 22nd US airstrike in Somalia this year, signalling a sustained escalation in Washington’s counterterrorism campaign in the Horn of Africa. Africom said the operation was designed to “degrade ISIS-Somalia’s ability to plan and conduct attacks that threaten the US homeland, our forces, and our citizens abroad.”

While Africom did not disclose the type of aircraft or munitions deployed, the strike is consistent with a broader pattern of drone-based engagements that the US military has relied on to maintain reach and precision across remote insurgent zones in East Africa.

The latest airstrike came just two days after Africom Commander General Michael Langley’s testimony before legislators in the oversight House Armed Services Committee, in which he underscored the growing security risks emanating from African jihadist networks. “Africa remains a nexus theatre from which the United States cannot afford to shift its gaze,...

- **URL**: https://www.ibtimes.co.in/israeli-strike-iran-recalibrating-geostrategic-dynamics-middle-east-beyond-884214
- **Published**: 2025-06-13 14:03:46
- **Author**: Major General Dilawar Singh
- **Content**: The Israeli airstrike on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2025 represents a watershed in the evolving landscape of Middle Eastern and global security. This meticulously executed operation, targeting the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment infrastructure, is not merely a demonstration of Israel's military prowess but a reflection of the persistent limitations of diplomatic engagement and the shifting foundations of international order. The event's significance extends far beyond the immediate destruction wrought on Iranian soil; it reverberates through regional alliances, global power structures, energy markets, and the very norms that underpin the international system. In this analysis, we explore not only the operational intricacies of the strike but also its multidimensional consequences military, political, economic, technological, and normative while situating it within the broader arc of contemporary geopolitics.

- **Published**: 2025-06-12 09:18:28
- **Author**: Diksha Modi,News18
- **Content**: For over a century, oil, also known as “black gold”, has dictated the contours of global power. Nations rose and fell on its availability, wars were waged for it, and alliances shaped around its flow. But in the 21st century, a different kind of resource is redrawing the world’s geopolitical map, i.e. rare earth minerals.
From the shimmering screens of smartphones to the whirring turbines of wind farms, from advanced missiles to electric cars, a new group of elements – once relegated to obscure paragraphs in geology textbooks – has quietly become the backbone of modern technology. Lithium, cobalt, neodymium, terbium and 13 others make up what the world now calls “rare earths”. These elements are no longer rare in relevance. They are central to the future.
Rare earth minerals have peculiar, powerful properties. They can emit light, conduct electricity efficiently, and exhibit magnetic behaviour, all qualities that make them invaluable in high-performance devices. When mixed with common ...

- **Published**: 2025-06-12 07:00:08
- **Author**: Kawala Xie
- **Content**: China’s military mouthpiece has called for the large-scale and centralised deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to fully realise their potential in any future intelligent warfare, amid rising tensions with the US in the Indo-Pacific.
In an article published on Tuesday, the PLA Daily urged “innovative” organisation and applications of unmanned systems, highlighting their “decisive and dominant” role in future conflicts, including the capability to conduct close-range precision strikes.
“Driven by technologies such as autonomous unmanned systems and advanced networks, unmanned combat innovation is undergoing dramatic transformation,” the article said.
“We must move beyond traditional thinking, abandon the conventional use of unmanned systems as merely auxiliary forces, and develop a new operational theory centred on their large-scale, centralised deployment.”
Citing Russia and Ukraine’s efforts to build unmanned systems forces, as well as the US Defence Department’s Repl...

- **Published**: 2025-06-12 06:28:44
- **Author**: Karishma Jain,News18
- **Content**: In June 2025, rare earth minerals became a flashpoint in US-China relations once again. In early April, China suspended export licences for several key rare earth elements, including neodymium and dysprosium, citing national security and environmental concerns. These minerals are critical to technologies ranging from electric vehicle motors to advanced missile systems. The move drew sharp condemnation from US President Donald Trump, who labelled it a strategic weaponisation of essential materials.
Following weeks of negotiations, China in June agreed to temporarily resume exports to the United States under a six-month licensing arrangement.
This move reminded the world just how reliant major economies are on China for these seemingly obscure but critically important elements. That a handful of elements could hold such sway over global supply chains has sparked renewed attention on rare earths.

Zelensky also expressed concern that U.S. military aid could be diverted away from Ukraine toward Israel amid the worsening conflict in the Middle East.

“We would like aid to Ukraine not to decrease because of this,” he said. “Last time, this was a factor that slowed down aid to Ukraine.” [...] Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump held a 50-minute phone call Saturday to discuss the escalating situation in the Middle East and Ukraine peace talks, Putin’s foreign affairs advisor Yuri Ushakov said.

According to Ushakov, Putin told Trump about the implementation of the agreements during peace talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, including the exchange of prisoners of war.

"This would indicate to us that near-term hedging is warranted," he said.

The mix of domestic and global tensions is a recipe for more uncertainty and unease across most markets, BCA's Gertken said.

- **Content**: Addressing the global trade landscape, the OECD outlook pointed to various economic risks, such as how further trade fragmentation, including new tariff increases and retaliatory actions, could intensify the growth slowdown and lead to cross-border supply chain disruptions, coupled with the potential for inflation to be more persistent than originally anticipated, notably for economies with higher trade costs or tight labor markets, which, in turn, could lead to more restrictive monetary policy [...] Where things go from there remains to be seen, of course. That is—and will continue to be—the working thesis until more trade deals are announced or there is some sort of definitive long-term tariff and trade permanence that drives supply chain certainty, which can, in turn, bring some stability and confidence to what is currently a bumpy road.

But regardless of how things shake out, continued fluctuations and uncertainty (there is that word again) figure to be prominently involved.

- **Content**: Across the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, we have observed a concerted effort to fortify supply chains, with companies opting for forward purchasing.

While this strategy can be effective in some cases, it does not always work as it assumes the supply chain has sufficient [...] For example, the EU has publicly available information–you can mine data for goods coming in and goods going out from the U.S. You have similar transparency getting it to the ports.

- **Content**: By Dr Imran Khalid

“We made a great deal with China. We’re very happy with it.” So declared President Donald Trump in his familiar tone of triumphant ambiguity on June 11, fresh off what was touted as a breakthrough agreement to restore a trade truce between the United States and China. But if history has taught us anything, it is that “done deals” in the Trumpian lexicon tend to be either dangerously fragile or conveniently fungible.

The latest accord, emerging from two days of intense talks in London, follows an alarming spiral in trade tensions that had once again threatened to upend global markets and rekindle the tit-for-tat tariff warfare that haunted the latter years of Trump’s first term. According to Trump, China has committed to lifting its restrictions on the export of rare earths – materials critical to the global technology and defense sectors – while the U.S. has agreed to a calibrated rollback of punitive measures, including the threatened revocation of visas for Chine...

- **Author**: Moon Hwan Lee
- **Content**: The latest round of the China-U.S. trade spat began with minerals and ended with visas. On June 11, the Trump administration announced a “done deal” with China: rare earth exports to the U.S. would resume, and in return, the United States would lift restrictions on Chinese students. Under the agreement, the U.S. imposed a cumulative 55 percent tariff on Chinese imports, while China agreed to resume exports of rare earths and magnets. In exchange, the U.S. reopened student visa access, reversing recent restrictions on institutions like Harvard. The shift became visible almost immediately. Harvard, previously caught in a quiet freeze, saw its student visas greenlit. Embassies received orders to restart processing. What looked like a discrete exchange revealed a deeper recalibration. Resource policy and academic mobility, once treated as unrelated, now converge in the same diplomatic calculation. The negotiation table has widened.

Just four years after the AUKUS agreement to share the production of a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines was signed to much fanfare in the presence of then Prime Ministers Scott Morrison, Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden, it’s facing its first existential crisis.

US President Donald Trump has launched a review to ensure the partnership conforms with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) dogma.

His expectations are high. AUKUS, however, is already a big ask.

Australia must produce nuclear engineers out of nowhere.

And Australia must somehow stump up the cash to do so.

By targeting people with permission to access their systems, then all that IT spending on cyber security infrastructure—firewalls, secure email gateways, network security, access control, security tools—becomes irrelevant, and their criminal activities become a lot simpler. [...] With modern cloud security infrastructure being relatively robust, humans, who can be lazy, forgetful and tired, are generally the weakest link. Why would a hacker spend the vast amount of computing power and resources it would take to brute-force into a system and steal or encrypt data when they can just trick or bribe a human into letting them in?

India stands poised at the edge of a transformative moment in its space journey as group captain Shubhanshu Shukla prepares to become the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station. This marks the nation’s return to human spaceflight after more than four decades since Rakesh Sharma’s 1984 mission to the Soviet Salyut 7 space station, a milestone that had remained unmatched in Indian space history until now.

While the Ax-4 mission was initially targeted for launch on June 10, 2025, it was subsequently delayed first due to adverse weather conditions and then postponed further after the detection of a liquid oxygen (LOx) leak during the static fire test of the Falcon 9 first-stage booster. The engineers at SpaceX identified the LOx leak as a potentially hazardous anomaly resulting either from thermal contraction, seal fatigue, or microfractures in the cryogenic delivery lines, prompting a comprehensive inspection cycle that includes disassembly of...

It comes after nearly five months of tactics that contravene existing laws and standards; yet, the Trump administration persists. Civil rights attorney Judith Bronwne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, called out the Trump administration’s escalating in Los Angeles as a “threat to our democracy and our communities.” “As the administration pursues aggressive and dehumanizing methods of immigration enforcement – relying on racial profiling to target those they suspect are immigrants and then kidnapping and deporting them without warrants, legal counsel, or judicial oversight – it is no surprise that communities across the country are standing up in solidarity with our immigrant families, neighbors, friends and coworkers,” Dianis said. “Dissent is being met with flash-bang grenades, te...

- **Content**: The war between Israel and Iran marks the culmination of decades of shadow-boxing between Tehran and Tel Aviv. This is a war that has long worn the mask of deniability, played out in assassinations, cyber operations, and various forms of entanglements from Damascus to the Red Sea. Its rules were unwritten but widely understood: escalation without full rupture. But now it’s unfolding in a surprise Israeli intelligence and military attack, which was met with a subsequent Iranian retaliation against Israeli military installations and strategic infrastructure.

While Israel’s capacity for precise targeting — its assassinations of nuclear scientists, the killing of Iranian commanders, and its strikes on enrichment sites — has rarely been in doubt, its broader strategic horizon remains conspicuously blurred. 

Official Israeli communiqués gesture, with ritual ambiguity, toward the language of victory and denying Iran nuclear capability, but the underlying ambition seems at once more elusive ...

- **Content**: Israel’s latest strike on Iran had nothing to do with dismantling the Iranian (civilian) nuclear program. Despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assertion that “the timing was fixed back in November 2024,” the real zero hour was designated only to undercut possible diplomatic framework that could have legitimized Iran’s nuclear development under international, verifiable, supervision. 

This war is not a preemptive blow against Iran —it is a preemptive strike against diplomacy itself. The Trump administration made a grave error by keeping Israeli officials closely informed of the sensitive progress in the secret negotiations. This privileged access allowed Israel to strategically time its military strike to sabotage diplomatic efforts at a critical juncture—undermining further progress just as it was beginning to take shape, and before any agreement could fully mature.

The government's One Canadian Economy Act is generating controversy inside and outside the House of Commons, with some arguing it confers king-like powers to rush projects deemed in the national interest to completion.

The Liberals say the bill is intended to fast-track major projects as Canada faces the urgency of a disruptive Donald Trump presidency.

"We have a trade war that is affecting sector after sector after sector. Canadian jobs are at risk. Canadians' livelihoods are at risk and, quite frankly, the prosperity of the country is at risk," said Tim Hodgson, the natural resources and energy minister, at a news conference Thursday.

Strains of Aspergillus are already in the U.S. but are expected to expand.

Climate change may be putting millions more people at risk from an infection-causing fungi, which is likely spreading due to warming global temperatures, scientists say.

Satellite measurements since 2001 clearly show significant changes in both solar radiation absorbed by Earth and the outgoing thermal radiation from Earth. [...] The most common way to assess how much warming we can expect from a given increase in greenhouse gases is to estimate the temperature increase from a doubling of atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Earth warms in direct response to the CO 2 increase, but this warming in turn drives other changes, such as increases in atmospheric water vapor, snow and ice melting and cloud changes. These changes are termed climate feedbacks and they all add to the initial warming. Cloud changes, in particular, [...] understanding of current climate change....

- **Content**: The Israeli strikes appear to have destroyed an aboveground nuclear fuel production site and electrical supply centers at Iran’s largest uranium enrichment center, at Natanz. The killing of some of Iran’s top nuclear scientists continues a long-running Israeli campaign targeting the expertise needed to build a bomb. But the first phase of the Israeli attacks did not hit the most likely repository of Iran’s near-bomb-grade nuclear fuel — and that may have been deliberate. [...] The Israel Defense Forces issued a news release on Friday afternoon saying that in a second wave of attacks, it had hit Isfahan, but not the fuel stockpile. Instead, it focused on laboratories that worked on converting uranium gas back into a metal — one of the last stages of building a weapon. But it said nothing about hitting the area where the fuel itself is stored.
