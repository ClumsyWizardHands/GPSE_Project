# Active Context
Last Updated: June 8, 2025

## Current Focus
- Added Deep Dive Analysis capability to GPSE
- System now produces both executive briefs AND comprehensive regional analyses

## Recent Developments

### 1. Deep Dive Analysis Enhancement (June 8, 2025)
- Created `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` with multi-file output capabilities
- Developed `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` for comprehensive analysis
- System now generates:
  - Executive Brief (1-2 pages)
  - 7 Regional Deep Dives (5-10 pages each)
  - Analysis Index linking all documents
- Each deep dive includes:
  - Complete source verification chains
  - Full temporal event sequences
  - Game theory actor modeling
  - Strategic inference sections
  - Counterfactual scenarios
  - Intelligence gaps

### 2. System Architecture
- **Executive Brief Version**: `main_crew_global.py` (standard output)
- **Deep Dive Version**: `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` (multi-file output)
- Both versions use the same agent configurations but different output strategies

### 3. Technical Implementation
- `MultiFileWriterTool`: Writes multiple analysis files in one execution
- `EnhancedStrategyDBUpdateTool`: Updates ChromaDB with all documents
- Enhanced communicator agent with detailed analytical preservation

## Active Tasks
1. ✅ Comprehensive system analysis completed
2. ✅ Deep dive capability implemented
3. ⏳ Consider testing the deep dive system with live data
4. ⏳ Monitor performance with larger output volumes

## Key Files Created/Modified Today
- `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` - Multi-file output tool
- `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` - Deep dive main crew
- `run_gpse_deep_dive.py` - Simple launcher script
- `GPSE_Comprehensive_Analysis_June2025.md` - System analysis document

## Known Issues
- Deep dive analysis will take longer (10-20 minutes vs 5-15 minutes)
- Higher token usage due to comprehensive outputs
- May need to monitor API rate limits with multiple large outputs

## Next Steps
1. Test the deep dive system with actual geopolitical data
2. Monitor output quality and completeness
3. Consider adding visualization capabilities for trend analysis
4. Potentially add email distribution for completed analyses
