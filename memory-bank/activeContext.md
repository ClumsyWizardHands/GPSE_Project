# Active Context - GPSE Project

## Current Work Session
**Date:** June 6, 2025
**Focus:** World News API as Primary Source for Global Coverage

## Latest Development: News Source Priority Updated

### Change Implemented
Modified `gpse_tools.py` to make World News API the primary news source:
- **World News API** is now Primary Source (best for global coverage)
- **Tavily API** is now Secondary Source (AI-enhanced search)
- **NewsAPI.org** remains as Tertiary fallback

### Rationale for Change
For the global version of GPSE, World News API is better suited as primary because:
1. **Explicit International Focus** - Name and design indicate global scope
2. **Better Regional Coverage** - More diverse sources from non-Western regions
3. **Geopolitical Relevance** - Designed specifically for world news monitoring
4. **Supports Global Mandate** - Better coverage of Africa, Latin America, South Asia, etc.

### Technical Implementation
The `_internal_news_search` function now queries sources in this order:
1. World News API (Primary) - For comprehensive global coverage
2. Tavily (Secondary) - For AI-enhanced contextual search
3. NewsAPI (Tertiary) - As additional fallback

All three sources are still queried simultaneously when available, ensuring redundancy and comprehensive coverage.

## Previous Context: Global Coverage Version Created

### Problem Identified
The original GPSE system had hardcoded bias toward China-US-Russia dynamics:
- News Scout goal: "focus on China-US-Russia dynamics"
- Geopolitical Analyst: "specialize in analyzing China, US, and Russia"
- Scout task: Lists "China-US-Russia" as first priority

This caused the system to filter out important developments from other regions even when the news tools collected them.

### Solution Implemented
Created `main_crew_global.py` with comprehensive changes:

1. **Agent Redefinitions**:
   - News Scout: Now covers "all regions and power centers worldwide"
   - Geo Analyst: Expertise spans "entire geopolitical landscape"
   - Communicator: Ensures "comprehensive coverage of global developments"

2. **Task Improvements**:
   - Scout Task: Lists 10 focus areas covering all global regions
   - Analysis Task: Requires analysis of "ALL regions where significant events occurred"
   - Communication Task: Mandates dedicated sections for each world region

3. **Explicit Requirements**:
   - "Do NOT over-focus on any single region"
   - "Include at least 2-3 developments from regions outside US-China-Russia"
   - "Analyze ALL regions where significant events occurred"
   - "Ensure balanced coverage - no region should dominate"

### Running the Global Version
To use the unbiased global coverage version:
```powershell
python main_crew_global.py
```

## System Configuration Status
- **ChromaDB Memory**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Multi-Agent System**: ✅ All agents functional
- **News Gathering**: ✅ World News API as primary, collecting diverse global news
- **Analysis Bias**: ✅ FIXED - Now provides balanced global coverage

## Key Benefits of Global Version
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Latin America get proper attention
2. **Regional Powers**: India, Brazil, Turkey, etc. are analyzed alongside major powers
3. **Non-State Actors**: Terrorist groups, corporations, criminal networks included
4. **Emerging Threats**: Climate conflicts, migration, cyber threats covered
5. **Cross-Regional Analysis**: How events in one region affect others

## Comparison
- **Original (`main_crew.py`)**: China-US-Russia focused, misses global context
- **Global (`main_crew_global.py`)**: Balanced worldwide coverage, complete picture

## Next Steps
1. Test the global version with updated news source priority
2. Verify World News API provides better global coverage
3. Monitor outputs to ensure all regions get appropriate attention
4. Consider documenting the improved global coverage in README
