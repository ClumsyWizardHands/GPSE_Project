- **Content**: WASHINGTON – Competition with China and tariff threats are fueling U.S. efforts to secure more critical minerals used to make semiconductor chips and other defense infrastructure, speakers said at a May 6 Axios event.

Why it matters:Critical minerals have become a national security asset and subject of global politics, with the Trump administration recently signing a deal with Ukraine locking in preferential access to strategic elements from that country. [...] President Trump in April called for an investigation into national security risks posed by U.S. reliance on imported processed critical minerals, including rare earth elements.
   He has also used a series of executive orders to try to bolster domestic supply chains, like fast-tracking environmental reviews for U.S. mining projects. 

In Congress, meanwhile, rare earth competition with China has galvanized both parties. [...] Axios Event: U.S. needs more critical minerals to compete with China, experts say

- **Content**: Fellow Senate Armed Services Committee member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said the news that Trump may abandon AUKUS “will be met with cheers in Beijing” and further weaken America’s standing in the world.

“At a moment when we face mounting threats from [China] and Russia, we should be encouraging our partners to raise their defense spending and partnering with them on the latest technologies — not doing the opposite,” she said.

Further, with the large security presence of the U.S. and its allies in the Caribbean, China would have nothing to gain from an offensive military posture in the region. Though self-evident, this explains why the U.S has chosen to frame China’s presence in the Caribbean not in economic terms, but as a technological and geopolitical “threat”—going so [...] Washington’s aim of permanent hegemony in the region is being challenged by an increasingly multipolar world, and this accounts for the US attempt to limit China’s influence in the Caribbean. For example, U.S. tariff assaults on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) stems from U.S. insecurities about China’s economic growth alongside its manufacturing and technological developments.( extension of infrastructural, technological, and other tangible material developments to states lower down on t...

- **Author**: Diksha Modi,News18
- **Content**: For over a century, oil, also known as “black gold”, has dictated the contours of global power. Nations rose and fell on its availability, wars were waged for it, and alliances shaped around its flow. But in the 21st century, a different kind of resource is redrawing the world’s geopolitical map, i.e. rare earth minerals.
From the shimmering screens of smartphones to the whirring turbines of wind farms, from advanced missiles to electric cars, a new group of elements – once relegated to obscure paragraphs in geology textbooks – has quietly become the backbone of modern technology. Lithium, cobalt, neodymium, terbium and 13 others make up what the world now calls “rare earths”. These elements are no longer rare in relevance. They are central to the future.
Rare earth minerals have peculiar, powerful properties. They can emit light, conduct electricity efficiently, and exhibit magnetic behaviour, all qualities that make them invaluable in high-performance devices. When mixed with common ...

- **Author**: Kawala Xie
- **Content**: China’s military mouthpiece has called for the large-scale and centralised deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to fully realise their potential in any future intelligent warfare, amid rising tensions with the US in the Indo-Pacific.
In an article published on Tuesday, the PLA Daily urged “innovative” organisation and applications of unmanned systems, highlighting their “decisive and dominant” role in future conflicts, including the capability to conduct close-range precision strikes.
“Driven by technologies such as autonomous unmanned systems and advanced networks, unmanned combat innovation is undergoing dramatic transformation,” the article said.
“We must move beyond traditional thinking, abandon the conventional use of unmanned systems as merely auxiliary forces, and develop a new operational theory centred on their large-scale, centralised deployment.”

- **Author**: Karishma Jain,News18
- **Content**: In June 2025, rare earth minerals became a flashpoint in US-China relations once again. In early April, China suspended export licences for several key rare earth elements, including neodymium and dysprosium, citing national security and environmental concerns. These minerals are critical to technologies ranging from electric vehicle motors to advanced missile systems. The move drew sharp condemnation from US President Donald Trump, who labelled it a strategic weaponisation of essential materials.
Following weeks of negotiations, China in June agreed to temporarily resume exports to the United States under a six-month licensing arrangement.
This move reminded the world just how reliant major economies are on China for these seemingly obscure but critically important elements. That a handful of elements could hold such sway over global supply chains has sparked renewed attention on rare earths.

As high level military leaders and defence honchos from the Indo-Pacific region landed in Singapore for the 22nd edition of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the US-China great power competition hogged the limelight, with all eyes and ears on US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth’s speech. This was his second trip to the Indo-Pacific region as the Trump administration’s top defence emissary following his earlier trip that included stopovers in the Philippines and Japan.
With Trump 2.0 mostly embroiled in the Russia-Ukraine and the volatile West Asian wars, watchers of Indo-Pacific affairs have, of late, questioned Washington’s priorities in the region. In the Indo-Pacific region, Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff pronouncements and the trade war with China have largely dominated prime time news.

He noted the claim that Saudi Arabia has realized the US security umbrella is “full of holes.”

Zarif criticized the West’s “normative self-centeredness,” especially Europe’s stance on human rights and the Holocaust. “Europe should forever feel ashamed of the Holocaust, but what does that have to do with Palestine and Gaza?” he asked.

He siad Iran is mistakenly bridging Europe and the US on key issues, including the 2003 nuclear negotiations, calling it a strategic misstep.

He further argued that Europe’s dependence on Israel has eroded its normative power.

It also encourages comparisons between Israel and Ukraine, asking what modern Ukraine can learn from the experience of Israel’s state formation. [...] The Ukrainian national flag is seen in front of a school which, according to local residents, was on fire after shelling, as Russia's invasion ...

- **Content**: Reuters reported earlier in the day that the U.S. is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy in Baghdad, according to US and Iraqi sources, and that Washington will let military dependents leave locations around the Middle East over heightened security risks.

It has bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

It's less clear why this is happening now.

Iraq has been the site of heightened tension and violence since the the start of the war in Gaza in 2023. [...] Iran-aligned armed groups repeatedly attacked U.S. troops, but that has subsided since last year.

However, the news coincides with deadlocked US-Iran nuclear talks.

Trump nodded to that on Wednesday, too:

JOURNALIST: “Is there anything that can be done to dial the temperature down in the region?”

TRUMP: “They (Iran) can't have a nuclear weapon, very simply.”

In a podcast interview out Wednesday Trump said he was less confident Tehran would agree to stop its nuclear program. [...] Meanw...

- **Content**: Rachel Reeves announced a major Defence funding injection as the globe teeters on the brink of World War 3. The Chancellor unveiled her Spending Review prioritising Britain's security, health and the lives of "working people". Defence spending will rise to 2.6% by April 2027 as part of the Government's plan to turn Britain into a "defence industrial superpower" . Ms Reeves quoted Sir Keir Starmer who said the global security situation meant a "new era for defence and security" was needed. Increased spending would lead to jobs across the UK, she added. She said: "A new era in the threats we face demands a new era for defence and security. That's why we took the decision to prioritise our defence spending by reducing Overseas Development Aid so that defence spending will now rise to 2.6% of GDP by April 2027 including the contribution of our intelligence agencies. "That uplift provides funding for the Defence Secretary, with a £11bn increase in defence spending and a £600m uplift for our...

- **Content**: Security concerns involving the People’s Republic of China, and worries over the strategic direction of the Trump administration, may serve to deepen electronic warfare collaboration in Asia-Pacific. 

“In the Asia-Pacific region, there is no collective security organisation like that in Europe,” wrote Lieutenant General (Retired) Jun Nagashima, a senior research advisor at the Nakasone Peace Institute. Nagashima was writing in a Chatham House publication entitled Security and the Frontier: UK-Japan Perspectives on Cyberspace, Outer Space, the Arctic and Electronic Warfare published in 2021. Chatham House is an international affairs think-tank based in London. The Nakasone Peace Institute performs similar research work, and is based in Tokyo.

He argued that, “Because of history, politics and regional characteristics, it is not realistic to establish a new NATO-type military organisation to cope with emerging risks and threats.” Nagashima has a point. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisa...

- **Content**: A cyberattack on any aspect of a space system can degrade situational awareness and readiness across all domains. As space becomes the connective tissue of joint operations, cyber becomes a mandatory overlay to all aspects — launch, orbital, terrestrial and link. A single breach can ripple across the entire mission, which is why cyber strategy must move beyond traditional offense and defense to become a core part of system design. [...] For space to function as an operational domain, we must build it like one — resilient, interoperable and ready for conflict. To achieve “tactically relevant space” we need to advance in four key areas: real-time, AI-powered data processing; open systems; decentralized execution; and cybersecurity — together enabling an agile, interoperable mission capability.

- **Content**: The latest round of the China-U.S. trade spat began with minerals and ended with visas. On June 11, the Trump administration announced a “done deal” with China: rare earth exports to the U.S. would resume, and in return, the United States would lift restrictions on Chinese students. Under the agreement, the U.S. imposed a cumulative 55 percent tariff on Chinese imports, while China agreed to resume exports of rare earths and magnets. In exchange, the U.S. reopened student visa access, reversing recent restrictions on institutions like Harvard. The shift became visible almost immediately. Harvard, previously caught in a quiet freeze, saw its student visas greenlit. Embassies received orders to restart processing. What looked like a discrete exchange revealed a deeper recalibration.

Just four years after the AUKUS agreement to share the production of a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines was signed to much fanfare in the presence of then Prime Ministers Scott Morrison, Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden, it’s facing its first existential crisis.

US President Donald Trump has launched a review to ensure the partnership conforms with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) dogma.

His expectations are high. AUKUS, however, is already a big ask.

Australia must produce nuclear engineers out of nowhere.

It must reinvent its industrial base after abandoning any pretence of being a manufacturing nation with the cancelling of the car industry two decades ago.

This must be capable of scaling the pinnacle of manufacturing technology, naval submarine building, before the 2040s.

And Australia must somehow stump up the cash to do so.

[...] Finkelstein, the co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, said such groups and the people who follow them represent what he described as “assassination culture” — in which targeted killings are considered acceptable by those who harbor an array of grievances.

The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor. [...] The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.

It reiterates the assembly's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected. [...] There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly.

VIENNA, June 12 (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations on Thursday for the first time in almost 20 years, raising the prospect of reporting it to the U.N. Security Council. [...] While the resolution alluded to reporting Iran to the U.N. Security Council, diplomats said it would take a second resolution to send it there, as happened the last time it was declared in non-compliance in September 2005, followed by referral in February 2006.

- **Author**: Tass
- **Content**: UNITED NATIONS, June 13. /TASS/. The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution that underscores the need to hold Israel responsible and ensure that it complies with the international law, a TASS correspondent reported.

The document was supported by 149 countries, including Russia, China, Oman, Saudi Arabia, France, Switzerland and Japan. 12 countries voted against, including Argentina, Hungary and the United States.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, documents adopted by the General Assembly are non-binding.

The resolution calls upon UN member states to take individual and collective measures in accordance with the international law and the UN Charter to ensure that Israel complies with its obligations. The document strongly condemns the use of famine as a warfare method and the existing barriers for humanitarian deliveries, underscoring Israel’s duty not to deprive Gaza residents of vital resources.

- **Content**: U.N. member nations voted overwhelmingly Thursday to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and unrestricted access for the delivery of desperately needed food to 2 million Palestinians.

The vote in the 193-member General Assembly was 149-12 with 19 abstentions. It was adopted with a burst of applause. 

The resolution, drafted by Spain, “strongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.”

Speaking before the vote, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon vehemently opposed the resolution. He denied that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war, calling the accusation “blood libel,” and insisted that aid is being delivered. 

Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.

General Assembly adopted, by a large majority, a resolution Thursday evening demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid for the suffering Palestinian people.

- **Content**: The Islamic Republic of Iran enthusiastically condemned the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations oversight body, on Thursday for passing a resolution condemning Iran’s illicit nuclear development — and announced plans to build a new uranium enrichment facility.

The IAEA passed the resolution after its director-general, Rafael Grossi, issued remarks to its board on Monday accusing Iran of, among other transgressions, maintaining at last three secret nuclear facilities, which he claimed the regime tried to “sanitize,” a sign that it was attempting to avoid appropriate IAEA oversight.

The resolution passed on Thursday was the first in almost two decades to find Iran in violation of its nuclear obligations and explicitly stated that Iran had committed “many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations.”

Brought forward by over 20 countries, the resolution strongly condemns the use of starvation as a weapon of war, demands a full lifting of the Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid, and insists on the protection of civilians under international law.

- **Content**: UNITED NATIONS (AFP): The UN General Assembly will vote Thursday on demanding an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza a week after the United States used its veto to stop a similar push in the Security Council.

Like the text blocked by Washington to protect its Israeli allies, the draft resolution before the General Assembly calls for “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire.”

It also demands “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” seized during the unprecedented Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7, 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza.

But the text submitted to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly — the majority of which traditionally supports the Palestinians — goes further than the thwarted Security Council resolution by taking direct aim at Israel.

It “demands that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately end the blockade… and ensure that aid reaches the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip,” which after more than 20 months of...

The draft legislation proposes to remove the requirement for UN approval to send Defence Forces abroad. It also plans to increase from 12 to 50 the number of personnel that can be sent overseas without the Government needing the support of the Dáil.

Defence Bill 2025

Nwanjoku who was speaking with Journalists on Democracy Day Anniversary on Thursday said Governor Peter Mbah’s administration has defied all the odds, governing not with theatrics but with results; not with fanfare, but with focus.

He said Governor Peter Mbah’s two-years’ story in Enugu State is that of transformation.

He said “One single issue that massively captures the scale of transformation in Enugu is the historic resolution of the state’s decades-long water scarcity.

“In his inaugural address, Governor Mbah made a bold promise: potable water to Enugu residents within 180 days. Many scoffed. Fewer believed. But today, with the commissioning of the 9th Mile 24/7 Water Scheme capable of delivering over 70 million litres of water daily, scepticism has given way to stunned applause.
