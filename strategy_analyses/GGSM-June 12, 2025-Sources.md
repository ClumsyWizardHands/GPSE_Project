- **Content**: The remains of a destroyed Russian tank sits in a field near the Russian town of Sudzha.

The Russians have the mass to absorb those losses. Ukraine has struggled with weapon and ammo shortages, as well as deficiencies in manpower. Ukraine turned to small, cheap drones as an asymmetric warfare alternative; Russia has employed uncrewed systems in battle as well.

China, another concern in the West, has built a similar kind of force, one with the mass to take losses. [...] Russia has one of the world's largest militaries backed by a large population. The country has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to pursue an attritional style of warfare, committing a lot of troops and weaponry to a fight to slowly wear down its foe.

Russia's invasion has chewed through equipment. The UK Ministry of Defense said in December that Russia had lost over 3,600 main battle tanks and almost 8,000 armored vehicles since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. [...] The "enormous rate of damage," ...

Further, with the large security presence of the U.S. and its allies in the Caribbean, China would have nothing to gain from an offensive military posture in the region. Though self-evident, this explains why the U.S has chosen to frame China’s presence in the Caribbean not in economic terms, but as a technological and geopolitical “threat”—going so [...] Washington’s aim of permanent hegemony in the region is being challenged by an increasingly multipolar world, and this accounts for the US attempt to limit China’s influence in the Caribbean. For example, U.S. tariff assaults on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) stems from U.S. insecurities about China’s economic growth alongside its manufacturing and technological developments.( extension of infrastructural, technological, and other tangible material developments to states lower down on t...

- **Content**: That appears to be the strategy Beijing has adopted since President Trump ramped up tariffs on Chinese goods in April in a bid to get China to import more American goods and export fewer of its own. Rather than yield, China has leaned on a trump card, its control of critical minerals — which the United States depends on — while steering the focus to protracted talks instead of concrete results. [...] “This cat-and-mouse game keeps the United States from making any headway toward addressing any of the underlying U.S. concerns about China’s unfair nonmarket policies,” Mr. Czin added.

- **Content**: Reuters reported earlier in the day that the U.S. is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy in Baghdad, according to US and Iraqi sources, and that Washington will let military dependents leave locations around the Middle East over heightened security risks.

It has bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

It's less clear why this is happening now.

Iraq has been the site of heightened tension and violence since the the start of the war in Gaza in 2023. [...] Iran-aligned armed groups repeatedly attacked U.S. troops, but that has subsided since last year.

However, the news coincides with deadlocked US-Iran nuclear talks.

Trump nodded to that on Wednesday, too:

JOURNALIST: “Is there anything that can be done to dial the temperature down in the region?”

TRUMP: “They (Iran) can't have a nuclear weapon, very simply.”

In a podcast interview out Wednesday Trump said he was less confident Tehran would agree to stop its nuclear program. [...] Meanw...

- **Content**: A cyberattack on any aspect of a space system can degrade situational awareness and readiness across all domains. As space becomes the connective tissue of joint operations, cyber becomes a mandatory overlay to all aspects — launch, orbital, terrestrial and link. A single breach can ripple across the entire mission, which is why cyber strategy must move beyond traditional offense and defense to become a core part of system design. [...] For space to function as an operational domain, we must build it like one — resilient, interoperable and ready for conflict. To achieve “tactically relevant space” we need to advance in four key areas: real-time, AI-powered data processing; open systems; decentralized execution; and cybersecurity — together enabling an agile, interoperable mission capability.

And the Security Service of Ukraine reported that the uncrewed systems used in its Operation Spiderweb attack against Russian aircraft at military airbases earlier this month switched to using AI to complete their mission if they lost signal with the operator. The security service said this was done using AI algorithms and manual operator intervention.

- **Content**: In addition to the CER Directive, the EU has also promulgated the Network and Information Security (NIS2) Directive to deal specifically with threats to the network and information security of its critical infrastructure organisations. This Directive requires entities to take an all-hazards approach to the security risk management of their network and information systems.

Some measures critical infrastructure organisations must take include: 

UK: Cyber Security and Resilience Bill [...] High-profile cyberattacks on leading energy providers only serve to back up this data.

Of course, Australia boasts a robust framework for managing critical infrastructure security, thanks to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (SOCI).

But Australia isn’t the only country dealing with constant attack attempts on its critical infrastructure assets – peers in the US, UK and the EU face similar – and often even greater – levels of threat. [...] At Noggin, we recommend introducing flexibilit...
