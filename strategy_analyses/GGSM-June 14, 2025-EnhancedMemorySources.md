- **Content**: The number of nations now operating in orbit or beyond is one major difference between the first Cold War “space race” and what is now unfolding. So too is the speed of technological advances and the role of the private sector, particularly SpaceX and its billionaire founder, Elon Musk.

The U.S. and its Western allies are currently in a race with a combined Chinese-Russian collaborative project to return humans to the moon. [...] While much of that face-off inevitably takes place in secret, developments in the last two years have included U.S. claims Russia was developing a nuclear device to explode in orbit, a classified U.S. unmanned “spaceplane” that landed in Florida in March after a reported record 434-day mission in orbit, and President Donald Trump’s mooted new U.S. “Golden Dome” missile defense shield.

Australia 'confident' in US nuclear sub deal despite review

The 2021 AUKUS deal joins Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States in a multi-decade effort to balance China's growing military might (COLIN MURTY)

COLIN MURTY/POOL/AFP More [...] Australia said Thursday it is "very confident" in the future of a US agreement to equip its navy with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, after the Trump administration put the pact under review.

- **Title**: US air power intensifies on ISIS-Somalia
- **URL**: https://horseedmedia.net/us-air-power-intensifies-on-isis-somalia/406523/
- **Published**: 2025-06-13 15:03:40
- **Author**: Horseed Staff
- **Content**: The mission, executed with no civilian casualties reported, marks the 22nd US airstrike in Somalia this year, signalling a sustained escalation in Washington’s counterterrorism campaign in the Horn of Africa. Africom said the operation was designed to “degrade ISIS-Somalia’s ability to plan and conduct attacks that threaten the US homeland, our forces, and our citizens abroad.”

While Africom did not disclose the type of aircraft or munitions deployed, the strike is consistent with a broader pattern of drone-based engagements that the US military has relied on to maintain reach and precision across remote insurgent zones in East Africa.

The latest airstrike came just two days after Africom Commander General Michael Langley’s testimony before legislators in the oversight House Armed Services Committee, in which he underscored the growing security risks emanating from African jihadist networks. “Africa remains a nexus theatre from which the United States cannot afford to shift its gaze,...

- **Published**: 2025-06-13 14:03:46
- **Author**: Major General Dilawar Singh
- **Content**: The Israeli airstrike on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2025 represents a watershed in the evolving landscape of Middle Eastern and global security. This meticulously executed operation, targeting the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment infrastructure, is not merely a demonstration of Israel's military prowess but a reflection of the persistent limitations of diplomatic engagement and the shifting foundations of international order. The event's significance extends far beyond the immediate destruction wrought on Iranian soil; it reverberates through regional alliances, global power structures, energy markets, and the very norms that underpin the international system. In this analysis, we explore not only the operational intricacies of the strike but also its multidimensional consequences military, political, economic, technological, and normative while situating it within the broader arc of contemporary geopolitics.

- **Title**: Rare Earth Elements: 21st Century's Oil And The New Global Power Struggle | Explained
- **URL**: https://www.news18.com/world/rare-earth-elements-21st-centurys-oil-and-the-new-global-power-struggle-explained-ws-dkl-9381964.html
- **Published**: 2025-06-12 09:18:28
- **Author**: Diksha Modi,News18
- **Content**: For over a century, oil, also known as “black gold”, has dictated the contours of global power. Nations rose and fell on its availability, wars were waged for it, and alliances shaped around its flow. But in the 21st century, a different kind of resource is redrawing the world’s geopolitical map, i.e. rare earth minerals.
From the shimmering screens of smartphones to the whirring turbines of wind farms, from advanced missiles to electric cars, a new group of elements – once relegated to obscure paragraphs in geology textbooks – has quietly become the backbone of modern technology. Lithium, cobalt, neodymium, terbium and 13 others make up what the world now calls “rare earths”. These elements are no longer rare in relevance. They are central to the future.
Rare earth minerals have peculiar, powerful properties. They can emit light, conduct electricity efficiently, and exhibit magnetic behaviour, all qualities that make them invaluable in high-performance devices. When mixed with common ...

- **Published**: 2025-06-12 07:00:08
- **Author**: Kawala Xie
- **Content**: China’s military mouthpiece has called for the large-scale and centralised deployment of unmanned combat forces at key locations to fully realise their potential in any future intelligent warfare, amid rising tensions with the US in the Indo-Pacific.
In an article published on Tuesday, the PLA Daily urged “innovative” organisation and applications of unmanned systems, highlighting their “decisive and dominant” role in future conflicts, including the capability to conduct close-range precision strikes.
“Driven by technologies such as autonomous unmanned systems and advanced networks, unmanned combat innovation is undergoing dramatic transformation,” the article said.
“We must move beyond traditional thinking, abandon the conventional use of unmanned systems as merely auxiliary forces, and develop a new operational theory centred on their large-scale, centralised deployment.”
Citing Russia and Ukraine’s efforts to build unmanned systems forces, as well as the US Defence Department’s Repl...

- **Published**: 2025-06-12 06:28:44
- **Author**: Karishma Jain,News18
- **Content**: In June 2025, rare earth minerals became a flashpoint in US-China relations once again. In early April, China suspended export licences for several key rare earth elements, including neodymium and dysprosium, citing national security and environmental concerns. These minerals are critical to technologies ranging from electric vehicle motors to advanced missile systems. The move drew sharp condemnation from US President Donald Trump, who labelled it a strategic weaponisation of essential materials.
Following weeks of negotiations, China in June agreed to temporarily resume exports to the United States under a six-month licensing arrangement.
This move reminded the world just how reliant major economies are on China for these seemingly obscure but critically important elements. That a handful of elements could hold such sway over global supply chains has sparked renewed attention on rare earths.

- **Content**: Zelenskyy also expressed concern that U.S. military aid could be diverted away from Ukraine toward Israel during renewed tensions in the Middle East.

“We would like aid to Ukraine not to decrease because of this,” he said. “Last time, this was a factor that slowed down aid to Ukraine.” [...] Attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. During the June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely.

The Chancellor unveiled her Spending Review prioritising Britain's security, health and the lives of "working people". Defence spending will rise to 2.6% by April 2027 as part of the Government's plan to turn Britain into a "defence industrial superpower" . Ms Reeves quoted Sir Keir Starmer who said the global security situation meant a "new era for defence and security" was needed. Increased spending would lead to jobs across the UK, she added. She said: "A new era in the threats we face demands a new era for defence and security. That's why we took the decision to prioritise our defence spending by reducing Overseas Development Aid so that defence spending will now rise to 2.6% of GDP by April 2027 including the contribution of our intelligence agencies.

“In the Asia-Pacific region, there is no collective security organisation like that in Europe,” wrote Lieutenant General (Retired) Jun Nagashima, a senior research advisor at the Nakasone Peace Institute. Nagashima was writing in a Chatham House publication entitled Security and the Frontier: UK-Japan Perspectives on Cyberspace, Outer Space, the Arctic and Electronic Warfare published in 2021. Chatham House is an international affairs think-tank based in London. The Nakasone Peace Institute performs similar research work, and is based in Tokyo.

He argued that, “Because of history, politics and regional characteristics, it is not realistic to establish a new NATO-type military organisation to cope with emerging risks and threats.” Nagashima has a point. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisa...

- **Content**: The latest round of the China-U.S. trade spat began with minerals and ended with visas. On June 11, the Trump administration announced a “done deal” with China: rare earth exports to the U.S. would resume, and in return, the United States would lift restrictions on Chinese students. Under the agreement, the U.S. imposed a cumulative 55 percent tariff on Chinese imports, while China agreed to resume exports of rare earths and magnets. In exchange, the U.S. reopened student visa access, reversing recent restrictions on institutions like Harvard. The shift became visible almost immediately. Harvard, previously caught in a quiet freeze, saw its student visas greenlit. Embassies received orders to restart processing. What looked like a discrete exchange revealed a deeper recalibration. Resource policy and academic mobility, once treated as unrelated, now converge in the same diplomatic calculation. The negotiation table has widened.

It was never going to be easy.

Just four years after the AUKUS agreement to share the production of a new generation of nuclear-powered submarines was signed to much fanfare in the presence of then Prime Ministers Scott Morrison, Boris Johnson and President Joe Biden, it’s facing its first existential crisis.

US President Donald Trump has launched a review to ensure the partnership conforms with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) dogma.

His expectations are high. AUKUS, however, is already a big ask.

Australia must produce nuclear engineers out of nowhere.

It must reinvent its industrial base after abandoning any pretence of being a manufacturing nation with the cancelling of the car industry two decades ago.

This must be capable of scaling the pinnacle of manufacturing technology, naval submarine building, before the 2040s.

And Australia must somehow stump up the cash to do so.

- **Content**: Between 1 January and 30 May, at least 2,680 people – including 54 children – were killed, 957 injured, 316 kidnapped for ransom, and many more subjected to sexual violence and child gang recruitment.

“Alarming as they are, numbers cannot express the horrors Haitians are being forced to endure daily,” said Mr. Türk.

Conflicts on all sides

In recent months, gangs have attacked Mirebalais in the centre of the country, looting police stations, destroying property and freeing over 500 inmates from the local prison.

Meanwhile, so-called self-defence groups have targeted individuals they suspect of gang affiliation. On 20 May, at least 25 people were killed and 10 injured by a group accusing them of supporting gangs.

Law enforcement has ramped up operations against them. Since January, police have killed at least 1,448 people, including 65 during extrajudicial executions.

- **Content**: Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Iranians to “rise up” and overthrow Tehran’s “evil and oppressive regime”.

As Iranian missiles rained down on Israel in retaliation for Thursday’s devastating attack on its military leadership and nuclear sites, Mr Netanyahu addressed the Iranian public directly.

“As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,” Israel’s prime minister said in a video address.

He added: “Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.”

Dozens of missiles were fired at Tel Aviv on Friday, in what the IDF said was an attack on civilians. The military said most of the missiles were either intercepted or fell short.

At least 34 people were injured in the attack, according to emergency services. Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said Iran had crossed “red lines” in its strikes and vowed to ensure the Iranian regim...

Grossi delivered the update during an emergency UN Security Council meeting in New York on Friday, where he and other senior UN officials urged both Israel and Iran to show restraint to prevent a deeper regional conflict.

“I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked regardless of the context or circumstances, as it could harm both people and the environment,” said Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

He reported radiological and chemical contamination inside the Natanz facility, where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60 percent. However, he added that the contamination is “manageable with appropriate measures”, and said the IAEA is ready to send nuclear security experts to help secure the sites if requested.

Trend reports.

the sites hit, he noted, was the Natanz nuclear facility, a

Iravani reported that 78 people, including senior military

- **Content**: Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Iranians to “rise up” and overthrow Tehran’s “evil and oppressive regime”.

As Iranian missiles rained down on Israel in retaliation for Thursday’s devastating attack on its military leadership and nuclear sites, Mr Netanyahu addressed the Iranian public directly.

“As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,” Israel’s prime minister said in a video address.

He added: “Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you. This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.”

Dozens of missiles were fired at Tel Aviv on Friday, in what the IDF said was an attack on civilians. The military said most of the missiles were either intercepted or fell short.

At least 34 people were injured in the attack, according to emergency services. Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said Iran had crossed “red lines” in its strikes and vowed to ensure the Iranian regim...

In a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Communications, Nneamaka Okafor, Lokpobiri expressed dismay that Senator Dickson, himself a Niger Deltan, chose a day meant to honour the country’s democratic progress to launch what he called a “misguided attack” on a President who has consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to democracy and regional development.

Some years it was from the amazing bakery in our old neighborhood, while others it was a questionably fresh effort picked up at a train station shop on the way home from the office, but often I would bake my own.

The funny thing is, neither of us really likes carrot cake. It just somehow ended up being the top layer of our wedding cake, so we have one every year. That's tradition for you.

This year, for our 20th anniversary, I had my mind set on baking. Throwing together a three-layer cake in the middle of a busy work day may sound daunting, but it's well within my skill set. And I was armed with a new recipe and a giant bag of carrots. I just needed a few key ingredients.

Slovakia celebrates its growing community of lifesaving blood donors

Slovakia has seen a steady rise in the number of blood donors for the fifth year in a row, thanks to improved public awareness, a user-friendly donor app and more engaging social media communication, according to the National Transfusion Service (NTS).

Between 2018 and 2023, the number of people willing to donate blood increased by more than 31,000 – roughly the population of a medium-sized district town.

The latest figures, released this week by the National Health Information Centre (NCZI), show that nearly 302,000 people gave blood in 2023, the most recent year for which full figures are available. That’s still below the 2017 peak of 324,000, but there has been a strong recovery in numbers following a sharp drop during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite this positive trend, demand for blood,...

- **Content**: President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and military against protesters in Los Angeles is widely being interpreted as a display of intimidation and state power ahead of his birthday, when Trump will oversee a military parade in Washington, D.C. in the style of a dictator. The president has warned that protesters in D.C. will be “met with very heavy force.” Democrats and civil rights groups say the president is inflaming tensions to justify further repression, crossing the line into blatant authoritarianism as demonstrations against his administration spread across the country.

However, perhaps the greatest consolidation of state power is not happening in the streets, but quietly being hammered out in courtrooms and behind closed doors, where Trump’s campaign of mass deportation is being used to justify a rapid expansion and centralization of the surveillance state.

- **Content**: President Donald Trump said "Los Angeles was safe and sound for the last two nights" on Thursday morning. By evening, Marines were positioned on the outskirts of the city.

Around 200 Marines armed with rifles, riot control equipment, gas masks, roughly 20 hours of civil disturbance training and the ability to temporarily detain civilians arrived in the country's second-largest city after days of public anticipation. They departed a naval base roughly 30 miles south of LA on Thursday night bound for the Wilshire Federal Building near Beverly Hills.

Their stated mission -- along with 4,000 National Guard troops who were called up -- is to protect federal functions, personnel and property in the city amid protests that began last week against the Trump administration's aggressive immigration raids across Southern California. Their deployment in the face of public unrest on American streets marks a precarious use of Marines for domestic purposes not seen in more than 30 years.

Its Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran ahead of time, and used them to target Iranian air defenses and missile launchers near Tehran, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

It was not possible to independently corroborate the officials’ claims. [...] Over the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran’s air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024 and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October.

The official said Israel is prepared for an operation that could last up to two weeks, but that there was no firm timeline. [...] Iran’s supreme leader on Friday said the country would “not show any leniency” and was prepared to counterattack after deadly Israeli attacks hit nuclear sites and military leaders in Iran.

The killing of some of Iran’s top nuclear scientists continues a long-running Israeli campaign targeting the expertise needed to build a bomb. But the first phase of the Israeli attacks did not hit the most likely repository of Iran’s near-bomb-grade nuclear fuel — and that may have been deliberate. [...] The Israel Defense Forces issued a news release on Friday afternoon saying that in a second wave of attacks, it had hit Isfahan, but not the fuel stockpile. Instead, it focused on laboratories that worked on converting uranium gas back into a metal — one of the last stages of building a weapon. But it said nothing about hitting the area where the fuel itself is stored.

In that sense, Iran might believe it already had enough justification to take on the U.S. and target American bases in the region—such as those in Iraq and member states in the Gulf Cooperation Council—thus expanding the scope of its target options.

The truck driver reconsidered. He stopped in the middle of the street, got out, and ducked inside our building to wait it out.
Across the Persian Gulf, Israel was carrying out a sophisticated attack against Iran’s capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Warplanes struck the Natanz nuclear facility, while other operations killed Iran’s top military general, the leader of its Revolutionary Guards, the head of its Air Force, and at least six nuclear scientists. News images showed apartment buildings in Tehran with smoke billowing from specific rooms, indicating precisely targeted attacks (though Iran said that eighty civilians were also killed). An unnamed security source told Channel 12 that the Mossad intelligence services had recently established bases inside Iran, where they kept precision missiles and suicide drones. The news aired grainy black-and-white footage of masked Mossad agents on the ground there, delicately setting d...

- **Author**: Brady Knox
- **Content**: Here is everything you need to know about the greatest military action taken against Iran since the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988:

What happened?

Israel and Iran have been on the brink of war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and sought to trigger a response from Iran and its proxies. Widespread battering of Iran’s proxies and allies across the Middle East, particularly Hezbollah in Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, increasingly emboldened Jerusalem, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeking to achieve his decadeslong goal of destroying Iran’s nuclear program with military strikes.

Despite Trump’s warnings to the contrary, Israel executed a series of long-range strikes against Iran. The plan took over eight months to make, according to Axios, and was one of Israel’s most complex operations yet.

Israeli air and missile strikes were reported against Tehran, Natanz, Iran’s main uranium enrichment facility, Tabriz, Kermanshah, and Borujerd. The Israel Defense F...

- **Content**: Leadership Development Is Broken, Because We're Asking the Wrong People If It's Working

The multi-billion dollar global leadership development industry has a dirty secret: most leadership development programs are evaluated by the very people who design and deliver them, not by the employees who are supposed to benefit.

It's like asking chefs to rate their own cooking while ignoring the diners who actually have to eat the meal. This fundamental flaw in evaluation methodology explains why leadership training continues to disappoint despite massive corporate investment in developing leaders.

After surveying over 150,000 employees, managers, and executives across hundreds of organizations, the evidence is clear: we've been measuring effective leadership development all wrong. While training departments celebrate completion rates and executives praise leadership program design, the people actually led by these "developed" leaders tell a dramatically different story—one that should force ...
