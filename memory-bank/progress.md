- ✅ Integrated all 5 specialized agents
- ✅ Standardized output format

### May 28, 2025 - Initial System Launch
- ✅ Base CrewAI implementation
- ✅ Basic agent structure
- ✅ Tool implementations

## Active Development

### Current Focus
- System is stable with two operational modes:
  1. Executive Brief Mode (main_crew_global.py)
  2. Deep Dive Mode (main_crew_global_deep_dive.py)

### Recent Achievements (June 8, 2025)
1. **Deep Dive Analysis System**
   - MultiFileWriterTool for simultaneous multi-file generation
   - EnhancedStrategyDBUpdateTool for comprehensive database updates
   - Regional analysis framework covering 7 global regions
   - Each analysis includes full source chains and strategic modeling

2. **Enhanced Output Quality**
   - Complete source verification chains
   - Temporal event sequences
   - Game theory actor modeling
   - Counterfactual scenario analysis
   - Intelligence gap identification

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Better memory management
   - Improved error handling
   - More efficient file writing

## Known Issues
- None critical at this time
- Monitor API rate limits during deep dive analyses
- Consider implementing progress indicators for long-running analyses

## Next Development Phase
1. **Visualization Layer**
   - Interactive dashboards for trend analysis
   - Geographic heat maps for regional tensions
   - Timeline visualizations for event sequences

2. **Distribution System**
   - Email integration for automated report delivery
   - Web interface for report access
   - API endpoints for programmatic access

3. **Analysis Enhancements**
   - Real-time news integration
   - Social media sentiment analysis
   - Economic indicators correlation

## Performance Metrics
- Executive Brief: 5-15 minutes runtime
- Deep Dive Analysis: 10-20 minutes runtime
- Token usage: ~50K-100K for executive, ~200K-500K for deep dive
- Output: 1-2 pages (executive) vs 35-70 pages (deep dive)

## Testing Status
- ✅ Unit tests for all tools
