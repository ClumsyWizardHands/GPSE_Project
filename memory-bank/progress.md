## Next Development Phase

### Phase 2: Strategic Pathways Modeler (Current)
1.  **Schema and DB Implementation**
    *   Implement `StrategicPathway` and `PathwayUpdate` Pydantic models in `schemas.py`.
    *   Add `add_pathway`, `update_pathway`, and `find_relevant_pathways` functions to `db_manager_enhanced.py`.
    *   Create new `strategic_pathways` collection in ChromaDB.
2.  **Agent & Tool Development**
    *   Create `Pathway Extractor` tool to identify pathways from analysis documents.
    *   Integrate extractor tool into `Communications & Archival Lead` agent.
