# Active Context
Last Updated: June 13, 2025

## Current Focus
- ✅ COMPLETED: Temporal Awareness Fix for GPSE System
- System now correctly identifies and describes past, present, and future events
- Ready for next iteration of improvements

## Recent Developments

### 1. Temporal Awareness Fix Implemented (June 13, 2025 - 5:00 AM)
- **Problem Identified**: GPSE was treating past events (e.g., "Israel struck Iran") as future possibilities
- **Root Cause**: LLMs weren't explicitly instructed to parse temporal markers
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added `TemporalEventParser` class with temporal marker detection
  - Updated Breaking Event Detector prompt with temporal instructions
  - Enhanced Analyst prompt with temporal accuracy requirements
  - Added temporal verification to Communicator prompt
  - Articles now tagged with temporal_status metadata
- **Test Results**: All temporal classification tests passing ✓

### 2. Enhanced Memory System Complete (June 13, 2025 - Earlier)
- **Breaking Event Detection**: Successfully implemented and tested
  - Detected Israel-Iran tensions, AUKUS crisis, rare earth competition
  - Adaptive search queries generated based on breaking events
- **Multi-Source News**: Integrated Tavily + WorldNewsAPI
  - 128 articles collected in test run (99 initial + 29 from adaptive searches)
- **ChromaDB Storage Fixed**: 
  - Created `db_manager_enhanced.py` supporting multiple formats
  - Successfully stored 100+ chunks from all existing analyses
  - Verified retrieval working with relevant results

### 3. Key Files Created/Modified Today
- `run_gpse_enhanced_memory.py` - Enhanced GPSE with breaking event detection + temporal fix
- `db_manager_enhanced.py` - Enhanced DB manager supporting all formats
- `test_temporal_fix.py` - Test suite for temporal awareness
- Successfully generated analysis with breaking events highlighted

### 4. System Capabilities Now Include
- **Four Operational Modes**:
  1. Executive Brief Mode (main_crew_global.py)
  2. Deep Dive Mode (main_crew_global_deep_dive.py)
  3. Memory-Enhanced Mode (run_gpse_improved_with_memory.py)
  4. Enhanced Memory Mode (run_gpse_enhanced_memory.py) - NOW WITH TEMPORAL AWARENESS!

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- Breaking event detector uses keyword detection + LLM validation with temporal context
- Multi-source deduplication by URL
- Enhanced chunking strategy handles both legacy and new formats
- Metadata includes format type and temporal status for better organization
- Temporal parser classifies events as PAST, PRESENT/ONGOING, or FUTURE

## Active Tasks
1. ✅ Phase 1: Enhanced Memory Implementation COMPLETE
2. ✅ Temporal Awareness Fix COMPLETE
3. ⏳ Phase 2: Prediction Tracking (Next iteration)
4. ⏳ Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Future)

## Known Issues - ALL RESOLVED
- ✅ ChromaDB storage issue FIXED
- ✅ All analyses properly chunked and stored
- ✅ Historical context retrieval working
- ✅ Breaking event detection validated
- ✅ Temporal awareness issue FIXED

## Next Steps
1. Run full GPSE analysis to verify temporal fix in production
2. Begin Phase 2: Implement prediction tracking system
3. Extract predictions from analyses with confidence levels
4. Build verification framework for tracking outcomes
5. Add prediction accuracy metrics
6. Consider visualization layer for patterns

## Performance Metrics
- Enhanced analysis runtime: 10-25 minutes
- Breaking event detection: ~30-60 seconds
- News collection: 128 articles in ~3 minutes
- ChromaDB storage: 100+ chunks successfully stored
- Query performance: 1-2 seconds per topic
- Temporal classification: <1 second per article

## Previous Context (Preserved)

### Memory Architecture Implementation (June 12, 2025)
- Created `run_gpse_improved_with_memory.py` with historical context integration
- System queries past analyses before generating new reports
- "Learning from Past Assessments" section added to reports

### Deep Dive Analysis Enhancement (June 8, 2025)
- Created `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` with multi-file output capabilities
- Developed `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` for comprehensive analysis
- System generates Executive Brief + 7 Regional Deep Dives
- Fixed shallow analysis issue with o1-preview model upgrade
