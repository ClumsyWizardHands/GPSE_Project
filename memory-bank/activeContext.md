## Current Task: Comprehensive GPSE Agent Enhancement

### Phase 1: Geo_Analyst Enhancement (COMPLETED)

#### Problems Identified:
1. **Vague, Non-Anchored Observations**: Generic statements without specific observable events
2. **Poor Source Integration**: No specific article citations or dataset references
3. **Symmetric Actor Treatment**: US-China analyzed identically instead of asymmetrically
4. **Surface-Level Scenario Analysis**: Generic predictions without game theory modeling
5. **No Adaptive Learning**: Missing comparison to past forecasts
6. **Low Semantic Density**: Templated language suggesting cached summaries
7. **Temporal Drift**: References to outdated patterns without current validation

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Workflow Discipline**: Mandated starting with specific current events, NOT historical context
- **Evidence Anchoring**: Required citation of specific events with timestamps
- **Dual-Source Synthesis**: Explicit integration of news_scout findings + ChromaDB patterns
- **Temporal Gap Awareness**: Must acknowledge training cutoff and bridge to present
- **Asymmetric Frameworks**: Required unique doctrinal analysis for each actor
- **Creative Inference**: Encouraged reading between lines while maintaining evidence base
- **Semantic Precision**: Exact military terminology and specific indicators required

### Phase 2: News_Scout Enhancement (COMPLETED)

#### Problems Addressed:
- Generic source requirements without specific standards
- No verification methodology for credibility assessment
- Lacks temporal precision
- No source bias acknowledgment requirements
- Output format doesn't enforce specific attribution

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Source Verification Standards**: Domain Authority, Editorial Standards, Fact-Check History
- **Bias Assessment Framework**: AllSides/MBFC classification mandatory
- **Temporal Precision**: Exact UTC timestamps for all events
- **Contradiction Protocol**: Document and analyze conflicting reports
- **Credibility Scoring**: Multi-factor 0-10 scale with justification
- **Quality Gates**: Minimum thresholds (Source ≥6, Quality ≥5, Relevance ≥7)
- **Enhanced Output**: Structured JSON with comprehensive metadata

### Phase 3: Communicator Enhancement (COMPLETED)

#### Problems Addressed:
- Verbose but lacks quality control gates
- No verification requirements for preserved metadata
- Missing learning integration checks
- No consistency standards for document formatting

#### Solutions Implemented:
- **Quality Control Checklist**: Mandatory validation before saving
- **Metadata Preservation Protocol**: Verify all strategic tags
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Check against historical patterns
- **Format Standardization**: Enforce GPSE standards
- **Learning Integration**: Ensure past assessment comparisons
- **Error Prevention**: Catch and correct common issues
- **Archival Excellence**: Intelligent chunking and tagging

### Phase 4: Task Enhancements (COMPLETED)

#### News Scout Task:
- Comprehensive verification workflow
- Structured JSON output requirements
- Source diversity analysis
- Exclusion documentation

#### Geo Analyst Task:
- Immediate action with specific events
- Structured 5-step workflow
- 12 mandatory analysis sections
- Evidence-based inference requirements

#### Communicator Task:
- Quality control checklist
- Cross-reference requirements
- Error correction protocol
- Detailed archival reporting

### Legacy Cleanup (COMPLETED)
- Legacy agents already removed from configuration
- System streamlined to 3 core agents: news_scout, geo_analyst, communicator

### Expected System Improvements:

1. **News Quality**:
   - Only verified, credible sources
   - Clear bias identification
   - Precise timestamps
   - Documented contradictions

2. **Analysis Quality**:
   - Specific event citations
   - Actor-specific frameworks
   - Evidence-based inferences
   - Creative pattern recognition
   - Temporal gap acknowledgment

3. **Output Quality**:
   - Pristine formatting
   - Complete metadata
   - Learning integration
   - Quality assurance verified

### Command to Run Enhanced System:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\every\Desktop\GPSE_Project
.\gpse_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main_crew.py
```

### Files Modified:
- `config/agents.yaml` - Enhanced all three core agents
- `config/tasks_simplified.yaml` - Enhanced all three tasks
- Created backups before modifications

### Implementation Complete:
All recommendations have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ High Priority: Enhanced news_scout with rigorous source verification
- ✅ Medium Priority: Added quality gates to communicator agent
- ✅ Low Priority: Legacy agents already cleaned up

The GPSE system now has comprehensive quality controls at every stage of the intelligence pipeline.
