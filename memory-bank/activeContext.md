# GPSE Active Context

## Current Development Phase
**Phase:** CrewAI Restructuring & Best Practices Implementation  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Sprint Focus:** Comprehensive review completed, implementing CrewAI best practices, added geo_analyst agent

## Recent Activities

### Completed Today (Session 3)
1. **Added geo_analyst Agent**
   - Defined new agent in `config/agents.yaml`
   - Role: Senior Geopolitical Strategist
   - Configured to use Claude 4 Opus (via powerful_llm)
   - Created specialized `StrategyDBQueryTool`
   - Tool provides structured metadata tagging:
     - [Actors], [Inferred Ends], [Means]
     - [Alignment Signals], [Flashpoints], [Scenario Potential]
   - Integrated into `gpse_crew_with_geo_analyst.py`

2. **Enhanced Strategic Analysis Capabilities**
   - StrategyDBQueryTool extracts deep strategic insights
   - Automated actor identification
   - Strategic ends inference
   - Means/methods extraction
   - Alignment detection
   - Flashpoint identification
   - Scenario assessment

### Session 2 Accomplishments
1. **Comprehensive Project Review**
   - Analyzed all memory bank files
   - Reviewed CrewAI best practices from documentation
   - Identified key improvements needed
   - Created `GPSE_Comprehensive_Review.md` with detailed findings

2. **YAML Configuration Created**
   - Created `/config/` directory structure
   - Implemented `agents.yaml` with all agents properly defined
   - Implemented `tasks.yaml` with complete task pipeline
   - Following CrewAI best practices for configuration

3. **Identified Critical Issues**
   - Missing API keys (immediate blocker)
   - Suboptimal CrewAI implementation pattern
   - Limited error handling and retry logic
   - Incomplete tool implementations

### Previous Session Accomplishments
1. Created `gpse_tools.py` utility module with CrewAI @tool decorators
2. Established memory bank structure
3. Installed all required dependencies
4. Created main_crew.py with basic structure
5. Fixed tool initialization and LLM instances

### Current Working Files
- `gpse_crew_with_geo_analyst.py` - Extended implementation with geo_analyst
- `config/agents.yaml` - Now includes geo_analyst agent definition
- `GPSE_Comprehensive_Review.md` - Complete project analysis and roadmap
- `config/tasks.yaml` - Task pipeline with context and tools
- `db_manager.py` - Existing ChromaDB interface (functional)
- `gpse_tools.py` - Updated with CrewAI @tool decorators
- `main_crew.py` - Needs refactoring to CrewBase pattern

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Choices
1. **YAML-based Configuration** - Adopted for better maintainability
2. **CrewBase Pattern** - Next implementation priority
3. **Conditional Tasks** - To be added for quality control
4. **Retry Logic** - Essential for production reliability
5. **Memory Enabled** - For better context retention
6. **geo_analyst Integration** - Added for deeper strategic analysis

### Implementation Roadmap
**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- Add API keys to .env file
- Test current implementation with geo_analyst

**Phase 2 (Next Session):**
- Refactor to CrewBase pattern
- Add task definition for geo_analyst
- Implement proper CrewAI tools
- Add error handling

**Phase 3 (Week 1):**
- Add conditional tasks
- Implement memory and planning
- Create test suite

**Phase 4 (Week 2):**
- Production monitoring
- Automated scheduling
- Full documentation

## Integration Points in Development

### Next Integration Steps
1. **Configure API Keys** - Critical blocker
2. **Create geo_analyst Task** - Need to define in tasks.yaml:
   - Strategic synthesis task
   - Metadata-tagged output
   - Integration with analysis pipeline
3. **Refactor main_crew.py** to use:
   - @CrewBase decorator
   - @agent, @task, @crew decorators
   - YAML configuration loading
4. **Test geo_analyst Integration**:
   - Verify Claude 4 Opus usage
   - Test StrategyDBQueryTool functionality
   - Validate metadata tagging

## Open Questions

### Technical
1. Should geo_analyst run parallel or sequential to strategy_analyst?
2. How to optimize task flow with geo_analyst?
3. Should we create separate output format for geo_analyst?
4. Memory optimization with verbose outputs?

### Operational
1. Cost implications of additional Claude 4 Opus calls?
2. How to balance verbosity with token limits?
3. Should geo_analyst outputs be separate documents?
4. Monitoring strategy for new agent?

## Current Blockers
- **API Keys Required**: Need to add all API keys to .env file
- **geo_analyst Task Definition**: Need to create task in tasks.yaml
- **Pattern Migration**: main_crew.py needs CrewBase refactoring

## Key Improvements Identified

### Architecture Improvements
- Move from direct agent definition to CrewBase pattern
- Use YAML configuration for flexibility
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Add conditional tasks for quality control
- **NEW**: Enhanced strategic analysis with geo_analyst

### Quality Enhancements
- Source validation (credibility > 0.7)
- Minimum article thresholds
- Retry on insufficient data
- Historical context validation
- **NEW**: Multi-layered strategic assessment
- **NEW**: Metadata-tagged outputs

### Cost Optimizations
- Use GPT-3.5 for news gathering
- Reserve GPT-4/Claude for analysis only
- Implement caching layer
- Consider local models for non-critical tasks
- **Monitor geo_analyst token usage**

## Next Session Focus
When returning to this project, the immediate priorities are:
1. **Add API keys to .env file** (critical)
2. **Define geo_analyst task** in tasks.yaml:
   ```yaml
   geo_analyst_task:
     description: >
       Perform deep strategic analysis with metadata tagging...
     expected_output: >
       Comprehensive geopolitical assessment with [Actors], [Inferred Ends]...
   ```
3. **Test geo_analyst integration** end-to-end
4. **Refactor to CrewBase pattern** using:
   ```python
   @CrewBase
   class GPSECrew():
       agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
       tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'
   ```
5. **Optimize task flow** with geo_analyst

## Success Metrics Defined
- 95%+ daily run success rate
- <15 min processing time
- <$20/day operational cost
- 15+ quality sources per analysis
- Zero manual intervention required
- **NEW**: Structured metadata in all outputs
- **NEW**: Historical pattern detection accuracy

## Notes for Future Sessions
- geo_analyst successfully integrated into agent configuration
- StrategyDBQueryTool provides enhanced strategic querying
- Need to create corresponding task definition
- Consider output format standardization
- Monitor performance impact of verbose outputs
- YAML configuration files created and ready
- Clear roadmap for improvements established
