# Active Context
Last Updated: June 14, 2025

## Current Focus
- ✅ COMPLETED: Research and planning for the Strategic Pathways Modeler.
- System is stable and ready for the next phase of development.
- **Next Up**: Phase 2 - Implement the Strategic Pathways Modeler.

## Recent Developments

### 1. Full System Test & Temporal Fix Validation (June 14, 2025)
- **Action**: Executed `run_gpse_enhanced_memory.py` to perform a full-cycle analysis.
- **Outcome**: The run completed successfully, validating the temporal awareness fix in a production-like environment. The system correctly identified past, present, and future events from a collection of 146 articles.
- **Details**:
    - Detected 4 breaking events and ran adaptive searches.
    - Queried 24 relevant historical analyses from ChromaDB.
    - Generated and stored the `GGSM-June 14, 2025-EnhancedMemoryAnalysis.md` report.
    - Stored 6 new analysis chunks into the institutional memory.
- **Errors Encountered & Fixed**:
    - `openai.BadRequestError`: Resolved by changing `max_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens` for the o3 model.
    - `anthropic.ValueError`: Resolved by implementing streaming (`.stream()`) for the long-form communicator agent call.

### 2. Temporal Awareness Fix Implemented (June 13, 2025)
- **Details**: The core temporal logic implemented on June 13 was proven effective in the full run. This includes the `TemporalEventParser`, updated prompts, and `temporal_status` metadata tagging.

### 3. System Capabilities
- The four operational modes are confirmed to be functioning, with the **Enhanced Memory Mode** now fully validated.

## Active Tasks
1. ✅ Phase 1: Foundational Research & Planning for Strategic Pathways Modeler COMPLETE
2. ⏳ **CURRENT**: Phase 2 - Implementation of Strategic Pathways Modeler
   - Implement `StrategicPathway` and `PathwayUpdate` schemas.
   - Enhance `db_manager_enhanced.py` with pathway-specific functions.
   - Develop and integrate the `Pathway Extractor` tool.
   - Develop and integrate the `Strategic Pathway Monitor` agent.
   - Develop and integrate the `Geopolitical Cartographer` agent.
3. ⏳ Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence (Future)

## Known Issues
- All previously known issues have been resolved. The system is currently stable.

## Next Steps
1. **Begin Phase 2: Implement the Strategic Pathways Modeler.**
   - Create `schemas.py` with Pydantic models.
   - Add `add_pathway`, `update_pathway`, and `find_relevant_pathways` to `db_manager_enhanced.py`.
   - Create a `Pathway Extractor` tool and integrate it with the `Communications & Archival Lead` agent.
   - Create the `Strategic Pathway Monitor` agent and a script to run it.
   - Create the `Geopolitical Cartographer` agent and integrate its reports into the main analysis loop.
2. Scope out requirements for Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence.

## Performance Metrics
- Enhanced analysis runtime: 10-25 minutes
- Breaking event detection: ~30-60 seconds
- News collection: 128 articles in ~3 minutes
- ChromaDB storage: 100+ chunks successfully stored
- Query performance: 1-2 seconds per topic
- Temporal classification: <1 second per article

## Previous Context (Preserved)

### Memory Architecture Implementation (June 12, 2025)
- Created `run_gpse_improved_with_memory.py` with historical context integration
- System queries past analyses before generating new reports
- "Learning from Past Assessments" section added to reports

### Deep Dive Analysis Enhancement (June 8, 2025)
- Created `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` with multi-file output capabilities
- Developed `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` for comprehensive analysis
- System generates Executive Brief + 7 Regional Deep Dives
- Fixed shallow analysis issue with o1-preview model upgrade
