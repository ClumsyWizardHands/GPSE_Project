# Active Context
Last Updated: June 8, 2025

## Current Focus
- Fixed shallow analysis issue in GPSE Deep Dive system
- Upgraded Geopolitical Analyst to use o1-preview reasoning model
- System now capable of much deeper analytical output

## Recent Developments

### 1. Deep Dive Analysis Enhancement (June 8, 2025)
- Created `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` with multi-file output capabilities
- Developed `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` for comprehensive analysis
- System now generates:
  - Executive Brief (1-2 pages)
  - 7 Regional Deep Dives (5-10 pages each)
  - Analysis Index linking all documents
- Each deep dive includes:
  - Complete source verification chains
  - Full temporal event sequences
  - Game theory actor modeling
  - Strategic inference sections
  - Counterfactual scenarios
  - Intelligence gaps

### 2. Analysis Quality Fix (June 8, 2025 - Latest)
- **Problem Identified**: Shallow analysis due to wrong model and token limits
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Changed Geopolitical Analyst from `gpt-4o` → `o1-preview` (reasoning model)
  - Increased token limit from 8,000 → 25,000 tokens
  - Increased iterations from 5 → 15 for comprehensive completion
  - Kept temperature at 0.7 as requested
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - Much deeper strategic analysis
  - Better game theory modeling
  - More sophisticated counterfactual scenarios
  - Enhanced strategic inference chains

### 3. System Architecture
- **Executive Brief Version**: `main_crew_global.py` (standard output)
- **Deep Dive Version**: `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` (multi-file output)
- Both versions use the same agent configurations but different output strategies

### 4. Technical Implementation
- `MultiFileWriterTool`: Writes multiple analysis files in one execution
- `EnhancedStrategyDBUpdateTool`: Updates ChromaDB with all documents
- Enhanced communicator agent with detailed analytical preservation

## Active Tasks
1. ✅ Comprehensive system analysis completed
2. ✅ Deep dive capability implemented
3. ✅ Fixed shallow analysis issue with model upgrade
4. ⏳ Consider implementing checkpoint system for regional analysis
5. ⏳ Test the improved deep dive system with live data
6. ⏳ Monitor performance with o1-preview model

## Key Files Created/Modified Today
- `communicator_agent_enhanced.py` - Multi-file output tool
- `main_crew_global_deep_dive.py` - Deep dive main crew (UPDATED with o1-preview)
- `run_gpse_deep_dive.py` - Simple launcher script
- `GPSE_Comprehensive_Analysis_June2025.md` - System analysis document

## Known Issues
- Deep dive analysis will take longer with o1-preview (15-30 minutes vs 10-20 minutes)
- Higher token usage with 25k limit
- May need to monitor API costs with o1-preview usage

## Next Steps
1. Test the improved deep dive system with actual geopolitical data
2. Implement checkpoint system for regional analysis preservation
3. Monitor output quality and completeness with new model
4. Consider adding progress indicators for long-running analyses
5. Potentially add email distribution for completed analyses
