## Current Task: Fixing GPSE Crew Execution Issues

### Problems Identified:
1. **Planning Mode Issue**: The crew was running in planning mode instead of execution mode
2. **No Actual Execution**: Agents were describing what they would do instead of actually doing it
3. **Zero Execution Time**: Execution completed in 0.00 seconds with no actual work performed
4. **No File Creation**: No analysis files were being created
5. **Context Window Overflow**: System attempting to summarize content ("Summarizing 1/12...") due to context length issues

### Solutions Implemented:

#### Version 1: `main_crew_execution_fix.py`
Key changes:
- Disabled planning mode (`planning=False`)
- Enhanced agent instructions with explicit execution requirements
- Added execution tracking callbacks
- Increased agent iterations
- Fixed output naming from "TestAnalysis" to "DailyAnalysis"

#### Version 2: `main_crew_optimized.py` (RECOMMENDED)
Additional optimizations for context window issues:
- **Better LLM Selection**:
  - GPT-4 Turbo with 128k context (`gpt-4-0125-preview`)
  - GPT-3.5 Turbo 16k version (`gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`)
- **Output Constraints**:
  - News scout limited to 5-7 articles, 2000 words max
  - Analyst limited to 1500 words max
  - Concise summaries enforced
- **Memory Management**:
  - Limited memory to last 5 interactions
  - Progressive summarization mode
- **Streamlined Tasks**:
  - Focused on quality over quantity
  - Clear word limits for each section

### Key Files Modified/Created:
- `main_crew_execution_fix.py` - Basic execution fix
- `main_crew_optimized.py` - Full solution with context optimization

### Next Steps:
1. Run the optimized version: `python main_crew_optimized.py`
2. Monitor for actual tool usage (should see API calls)
3. Verify execution takes several minutes (not 0 seconds)
4. Check for file creation: `strategy_analyses/GGSM-060325-DailyAnalysis.md`
5. Review logs for any errors

### Expected Behavior:
- Execution time: 2-10 minutes
- Clear tool usage messages in output
- No context overflow warnings
- Successful file creation and database update
- Concise, focused analysis output

### Command to Run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\every\Desktop\GPSE_Project
.\gpse_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main_crew_optimized.py
